# Transformers Q\&A Chatbot

This repository contains the code and data for building a conversational Q\&A chatbot using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

The core of the project is detailed in the `transformers_Chatbot_Q&Av2.ipynb` notebook. The chatbot is trained or fine-tuned on the `dialogs.txt` dataset to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.

##  Project Overview

This project implements a question-answering system using a pre-trained Transformer model. The goal is to create a bot that can understand context from a conversation and provide accurate answers. This implementation leverages the power of models like BERT, GPT-2, or T5 for natural language understanding and generation.

##  Repository Structure

  * **`transformers_Chatbot_Q&Av2.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps:
      * Data loading and preprocessing (`dialogs.txt`).
      * Model selection and tokenization (e.g., `pipeline` or `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering`).
      * Model fine-tuning (if applicable).
      * Examples and inference logic for testing the chatbot.
  * **`dialogs.txt`**: The raw text file containing the conversational data used to train or provide context to the chatbot. This file consists of user queries and bot responses, or context paragraphs for the Q\&A model.
